<p>I love playing Diablo 3. The idea of continuously being able to progress and
better yourself appeals to me. However, some time ago I lost interest in the
game. I had been stuck playing Torment 4 for months, and didn’t know what the
next step to improving was. Legendary drop rates in my difficulty level were not
good enough to acquire my next game-changing piece of gear. With no
<a href="http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/boon-of-the-hoarder" target="_blank">Boon
of the Hoarder</a>, I had no gold to refine my gems. I could scrape through a
Greater Rift 20 at best. I was stuck with one build, and I could feel my
gameplay stagnating.</p>

<p>Recently, I revisited Diablo 3 and made a giant spurt of progress! One tiny
breakthrough led to another, and now I’m about to finish a Greater Rift 50! I
cruise through Torment X. I have three or four builds that I rotate between
regularly. I have more money than I know what to do with.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the things that I followed in order to make my progress.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a Seasonal Hero</li>
  <li>Spend fast</li>
  <li>Survivability first</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="create-a-seasonal-hero">Create a Seasonal Hero</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Rewards are a great start</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="spend-fast">Spend fast</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Investments return exponential dividends</li>
  <li>Don’t hold on “until the time is right”. Use it fast, and you’ll get two more
before you know it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="survivability-first">Survivability first</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Monks have ridiculous attack speed</li>
  <li>A couple of weapons with Life On Hit, plus some damage reduction, can make you
invincible</li>
</ul>

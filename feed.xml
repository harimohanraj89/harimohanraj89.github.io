&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-diablo-midlife-crisis&quot;&gt;My Diablo Midlife Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love playing Diablo 3. The idea of continuously being able to progress and
better yourself appeals to me. However, some time ago I lost interest in the
game. I had been stuck playing Torment 4 for months, and didn’t know what the
next step to improving was. Legendary drop rates in my difficulty level were not
good enough to acquire my next game-changing piece of gear. With no
&lt;a href=&quot;http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/boon-of-the-hoarder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boon
of the Hoarder&lt;/a&gt;, I had no gold to refine my gems. I could scrape through a
Greater Rift 20 at best. I was stuck with one build, and I could feel my
gameplay stagnating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I revisited Diablo 3 and made a giant spurt of progress! One tiny
breakthrough led to another, and now I’m about to finish a Greater Rift 50! I
cruise through Torment X. I have three or four builds that I rotate between
regularly. I have more money than I know what to do with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of the things that I followed in order to make my progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a Seasonal Hero&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend fast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Survivability first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-a-seasonal-hero&quot;&gt;Create a Seasonal Hero&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Seasons are a great way to get a head-start on some awesome gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In exchange
for completing some special objectives through the campaign, you are awarded up
to 6 pieces of a class  set. For example, I completed Season 5’s objectives to
receive the 6-piece
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diablowiki.net/Monkey_King%E2%80%99s_Garb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
Monkey King’s Garb&lt;/a&gt; set. What’s more, you receive this gear two pieces at a
time, and can immediately start using the first two pieces you receive to make
it easier to obtain the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spend-fast&quot;&gt;Spend fast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The better gear you have, the higher difficulty you can play at. The higher the
difficulty that you’re playing at, the more likely you are to get better gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that investments to improve the quality of your gear pay exponential
dividends. Are you saving up a bunch of Imperial Emeralds until you have enough
(and enough money) to combine them into a Flawless Royal Emerald? Don’t! Socket
them in your gear right away! The improvement to your stats will allow you to
immediately reap dividends from the gems that you have collected, enabling you
to play at a higher difficulty. Chances are, you’ll earn back the used gems
very soon. To sum up,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t hold on to things “until the time is right”. The right time is right
away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;survivability-first&quot;&gt;Survivability first&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge for me when attempting to play at the higher Torment
levels was staying alive, or maximizing the amount of damage that you can take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of damage you can take depends on your Toughness (roughly speaking,
how much health do you have) and your Recovery (how fast do you regain health).
Having loads of Toughness and no Recovery is quite useless. You will steadily
lose health at the hands of every mob that attacks you, until you eventually die.
On the other hand, if you prioritize Recovery over Toughness, you will be able
to “live forever”. You will be able to recover your health faster than mobs can
deal damage to you, rendering you invincible. The one caveat here is that you
must possess enough Toughness to avoid being one-shot by scarier monsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I implement this strategy? Life On Hit is a statistic that grants you a
certain amount of health every time you hit a mob. It scales with attack speed.
Well, monks happen to have some of the fastest attack speeds out there. Hence,
I decided to tune my gear towards maximizing my Attack Speed and my Life On Hit.
After socketing every diamond I owned in my gear to increase my resistances, I
became the Diablo equivalent of Wolverine. I could stand in one spot and
relentlessly beat on mobs, while my super-healing powers kept me alive forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could now play at higher difficulties. My damage output was terrible, but it
didn’t matter. I didn’t mind taking a while to kill things, because the greater
rewards for clearing a Nephalem Rift in a higher Torment level justified the
extra time it took to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month or two after following this approach, I now have my very own Inna’s set,
Uliana’s set, and a bunch of splendid legendaries. I can mix and match to try
out new interesting builds. I can turn myself into a glass cannon to “farm”, or
I can put on my best suit to clear a Greater Rift 50. All in all, Diablo is fun
again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you relate to this Diablo “mid-life crisis” that I went through, I hope this
approach will help you get over the hump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view an example build that I used to get from Torment IV to Torment VII
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diablofans.com/builds/78647-life-on-hit-monk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;

        <title>Medical Sonification</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sonification is the representation of any data or information through the sense
of sound, as opposed to more conventional methods, such as plots, graphs, visual
displays, etc. This particular project deals with the use of sound to represent
medical imaging data, with a focus on supplementing existing diagnosis
techniques for identifying Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-data&quot;&gt;The Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical imaging data is stored in a standardized format called DICOM. The
datasets that are handled in this project are three-dimensional scans of human
brains that have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, with varying levels of
progression. These datasets are converted into easily readable (by humans and
computers) text files utilizing MATLAB’s inbuilt functions to read DICOM files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-sonification-tool&quot;&gt;The Sonification Tool&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magic happens in the C++ tool that I developed named SoniScan++ (the MATLAB
prototype was named SoniScan, and is shown below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;boxsize large&quot; src=&quot;/images/sonificationmatlab.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the user is presented with the option to “sonify” a dataset in a number of
ways. Some of the sonification techniques are voxel(volumetric pixel)-to-note
mappings. Here, each datapoint, or voxel, is assigned a note to play on a
pre-determined scale, and the various properties of the voxel, namely its
position and value, are mapped to different parameters of the note to be played,
such as which instrument should play the note, or how long and loud the note
should play. The result is musical piece of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videowrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/SPxJu1Vqx0E?controls=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
    A healthy brain, where pitch is mapped to the y-axis, and time to the x-axis.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videowrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/aB-JXwb3Ido?controls=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
    A brain with severe Alzheimer&#39;s, where pitch is mapped to the y-axis, and time to the x-axis.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another sonification technique involves dividing the brain into its lobes,
computing the average intensity of each region, and mapping that intensity to
the frequency of a simple tone corresponding to that region. The result is a
textural drone. The results of this technique seem to be quite promising for the
improvement of consistency in diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videowrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe class=&quot;boxsize&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/vUmi-EeX-EE?controls=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;
    A healthy brain, where pitch is mapped to the y-axis, and time to the x-axis.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videowrapper&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;

        <title>Two Dimensional Mixer</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;boxsize large&quot; src=&quot;/images/thumbtwodmixer.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This two dimensional mixer was the product of the final project assignment in my
Advanced Game Audio class. The class was dedicated to learning the sound design
and implementation aspects of popular video game engines such as Unity3D and the
UnrealEngine. This two-dimensional mixer is mockup of a possible sound design
tool to blend various sound sources to form a convincing sound for a game object
(for example, to model the sound of a crowd at a football game).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blue XY-pad is the mixer, which is manipulated with the mouse. The user can
choose between various panning methods, such as equal power or equal gain. There
are individual channel controls (gain, solo, mute, play, pause) for each of the
four audio sources. Another cool feature of this patch is that it has a
framework to communicate via UDP, so in theory, it can be controlled remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The header image on this page looks pretty, but the sad reality of PureData
(vs MaxMSP, for example) is the absence of a presentation mode. Hence, the
actual patch looked something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;boxsize large&quot; src=&quot;/images/twodmixerdetailed.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch is available for download below, if you feel like taking this patch
for a ride. The download also contains some sample audio to get up and running.
Remember, all user controls are in red!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Virtual Guitar Processor</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;boxsize large&quot; src=&quot;/images/virtualgp.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This virtual guitar processor was the product of the final project assignment in
my Advanced Digital Signal Theory class. The class was dedicated to learning the
implementation of common musical effects from scratch. hence, for the final
project, I decided to consolidate all we had learned into a single PureData
patch that would serve as a virtual guitar processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guitar processor implemented the following features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distortion: A choice of sinusoidal, polynomial, or diode-modeled distortions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Equalization: A 3-band parametric equalizer, with two shelf bands and a peak
  band in the middle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Effects: A parametric effects rack, providing vibrato, flanger, chorus,
  doubling (like a slap-back echo)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delay: A parametric delay, with wet volume and feedback control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reverb: A reverb engine using a feedback delay network, with wet volume and
  reverb time control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The header image on this page looks pretty, but the sad reality of PureData (vs
MaxMSP, for example) is the absence of a presentation mode. Hence, the actual
patch looked something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;boxsize large&quot; src=&quot;/images/virtualgpdetailed.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I was able to produce some cool sounds with this patch (mainly using my
bass guitar) and even used it for a live performance in a Distributed
Performances class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;distinct&quot; href=&quot;/downloads/VirtualGP.zip&quot;&gt;Download the patch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

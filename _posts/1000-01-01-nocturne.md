In my second year at IIT Madras, I met
[Sanjay Guruprasad](http://www.thoughtarium.com). From then on, the two of us
spent our time working together on projects of music, theater, and more
recently, web development. We co-founded Nocturne, a web design and development
studio, and have a few projects under our name. So far, we have focused on
building websites based on a solid framework, like Wordpress, and completely
customizing the user's front-end experience.

My adventure with Nocturne is quite a nascent one, but is proving to be very
exciting. Being able to channelize both my technical and aesthetic energy
through a single medium has been rewarding. You can check us out

Hi there.

Currently, I am a Web Development Instructor at <a
href="http://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive"
target="_blank">General Assembly.</a> I teach students who have little to no
programming experience over a period of 12 weeks to prepare them to enter the
work force as competent and confident junior web developers.

I was a graduate student at New York University, majoring in
<a href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/technology/" target="_blank">Music
Technology</a>. Our program covered everything from recording and mixing in the
studio to programming complex audio signal processing systems. As you can
probably tell, I enjoy the more technical aspects of our program, and work on
projects involving immersive audio, game audio, and the web. I joined NYU in the
Fall of 2011, and expect to graduate by the end of Fall 2013.

I spent the four years of my undergraduate life at the
<a href="http://www.iitm.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology,
Madras</a>. I graduated from IITM in the Summer of 2011, with a bachelors
degree in Engineering Physics. This program was an even blend of theoretical and
applied physics, and electrical engineering. I spent most of my time here
studying digital signal theory, learning how to live life on my own, and
organizing (and participating in, of course) music and theater events all year
round.

Music has been a part of my life since I started piano classes at the age of
four. Since then, I've shifted my focus to the electric bass, and continue to
play with as many people as I have time for.

If you like my work, or have any questions or comments, I'd love to hear from
you. Shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:hari.mohanraj89@gmail.com"
